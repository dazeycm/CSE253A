# What is meant by the setence: "Python is portable."
Python is considered portable because it compiles and runs on almost every major platform available. Furthermore, it will perform exactly the same on all of these platforms.

# A friend makes the following statement: “Python is used for small programs that are appropriate only for personal use.” Support or refute your friend’s statement using the readings from the textbook.
I would strongly refute these claims. In the textbook, it mentions that python is used in a wide variety of very professional and widely used projects.

# What does the textbook identify as a negative aspect to using Python.
One downside discussed in the text is that the execution time of a python script may not be as fast as a language that works more closely with the hardware.

# Determine the value Python produces when evaluating the following expressions:
* 10 / 3 = 3.33333333333333333335
* 10 // 3 = 3
* 10 % 3 = 1
* 5.5 % 2.5 = .5
* 2 + 3 * 4 = 14
* 3 * 4 + 2 = 14
* (2 + 3) * 4 = 20
* 10 ** 2 + 2 = 102
* 10 \*\* 2 \*\* 2 = 10000

# Write Python expressions for the following mathematical formula: `(cos(x) * sin^y(x)/pi) + x^y`

`(math.cos(x) * math.pow(math.sin(x), y)  / math.pi) + math.pow(x, y)`

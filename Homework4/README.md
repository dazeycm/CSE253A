# GUI Reasoning


I got the idea for my calculator from last year when I took 278. To double check that I was doing my conversion correctly, I would always use some online conversion tool. 


To use my calculator, enter the numbers you want to have translated into the boxes and check a box to indicate whether you want the output to be 'fancy', that is, for it to tell you what number you're converting from. After this, click computer.


My equations mostly consisted of using python's built in functions to handle the conversions, with a lot of input checking to ensure the program wouldn't crash, no matter the input!
